I am a PhD student in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics (CBB) program at Yale University, where I am fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Yuval Kluger](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/kluger/) and [Prof. Rong Fan](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/rong-fan). Prior to my PhD, I earned a B.S. in Integrated Science from Peking University with a focus on applied math and biology. I also conducted research in the [Lin lab](http://www.thelinlab.org/index.html) and [van Dijk lab](https://www.vandijklab.org). I am currently building better single-cell models at [Arc](https://arcinstitute.org).

I work at the intersection of statistics, deep learning, and computational biology.
