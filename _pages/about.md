(The site is under construction.)

I am a CBB (Computational Biology & Bioinformatics) PhD student at Yale University. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Prof. Yuval Kluger](https://medicine.yale.edu/lab/kluger/) and [Prof. Rong Fan](https://seas.yale.edu/faculty-research/faculty-directory/rong-fan). Before my PhD, I earned BS degree in Integrated Science from Peking University, focusing on applied math and biology. During my undergraduate, I did research in [Lin lab](http://www.thelinlab.org/index.html) at Peking University and worked as a research intern in [van Dijk lab](https://www.vandijklab.org) at Yale University.

I have a broad research interest in causal representation learning, generative models, and interpretable machine learning. My work aims to develop novel machine learning approaches to reveal novel biological insights in single-cell data and spatial omics data. In my recent works, I developed causal frameworks to investigate perturbation responses in scRNA-seq data (**CINEMA-OT**) and identify causal communicating genes in spatial omics data (**GEASS**). More recently, I developed a variational inference framework (**SIMVI**) that systematically reveals cell intrinsic variation and intercellular communications for spatial omics data. Besides these, I also enjoy collaborating with experimentalists to analyze new biological data, or working on fundamental machine learning problems.

Feel free to contact me if you are interested in a potential collaboration or just a chat!
